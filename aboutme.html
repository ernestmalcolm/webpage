<h1>This is the About Me page</h1>
<p>
    <h2>Educational background.</h2><br>
    My education story kicked off in Ruvuma at <b>St. Joseph's Primary School</b>
    where I studied to grade2 and my parents were shifted to Kilimanjaro where I moved to a school,
    <b>Eden Garden Education Trust</b> from grade 3 to grade 5(2010). Due to various issues, I moved
    to Dar es salaam where I was enrolled in <b>Academic International Primary School</b>
    where I did my grade 5 (again) and grade 6 and I finished my primary education at 
    <b>St. Joseph Millenium Primary School</b>. <br>
    My 4 years secondary education wasall covered in <b>Rosmini Secondary School</b> in Tanga from 
    2013 to 2017.  <br>
    I attended my High School education at <b>Feza Boys' Secondary School</b> for 2years where I 
    earned myself enough credits to get enrolled at the <b>University of Dar es salaam.</b>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>My University endeavour</h2><br>
    I am currently pursuing a <b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</b> at the  
    <b>University of dar es salaam.</b> My enrollment to this programme is courtesy of my 
    die-hard long term passion for Computer technologies from phones and laptops to 
    softwares, applications and games. This pushed me to wanting to be part of not only knowing
    how it comes around but also be in the worldwide team of software development and programming. <br>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Sponsorship</h2><br>
    My university studies and program is being sponsored by my parents. 
    No sponsorship from HESLB nor scholarships.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Discussion Groups</h2>
    I have happened to take part in discussions with different groups in my university endeavours
    so far but I have been a permanent member of two. They both include characters of different 
    personalities which makes the groups charming and successful as well in pursuing our degrees.
    One is <b>THE CS LADS</b> who are my colleagues from High School and the other is of friends 
    I have made at UDSM.
